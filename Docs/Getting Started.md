# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with the project is to host it on google colab. Alternatively, you can run the code on your local machine.

## Hosting on google colab
1. Create a Google Colab account or login to it if you already have one.
2. Go to your Google Drive and inside folder `Colab Notebooks` create another folder named `Mutual Funds Analysis`.
3. Upload the Notebook `MF Analyzer.ipynb` and the JSON file `MF Portfolio.JSON` inside this folder.
4. Open the notebook in colab and start playing around.
5. Note based on whether you're running notebook in google colab, you may need to comment or uncomment few lines of code. They are described in comments in the notebook.

## Running code on local machine
 1. Make sure following dependencies are installed. Else install them. The installation instructions can be searched online based on operating system.
	 - Git
	 - Python3.7
	 - Jupyter-Notebook
 2. Clone this Repository. This can be done using `git clone https://github.com/rishabhrkaushik/MF-Investment-Analyser.git`
 3. Install required Python Libraries. This can be done using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
 4. Create your own portfolio. Refer `Create MF Portfolio JSON.md` file in docs folder for the same.
 5. Run the MF Analyzer notebook on Jupyter. You can find the procedure to run any notebook in Jupyter online.
